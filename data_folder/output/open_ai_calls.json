Follow these strategic guidelines when responding:\n\n1. **Related and Inferred Experience:**\n   - **Similar Technologies:** If experience with a specific technology is not explicitly stated, but the candidate has experience with similar or related technologies, provide a plausible number of years reflecting this related experience. For instance, if the candidate has experience with Python and projects involving technologies similar to Java, estimate a reasonable number of years for Java.\n   - **Projects and Studies:** Examine the candidate’s projects and studies to infer skills not explicitly mentioned. Complex and advanced projects often indicate deeper expertise.\n\n2. **Indirect Experience and Academic Background:**\n   - **Type of University and Studies:** Consider the type of university and course followed.\n   - **Exam Grades:** Consider exam grades achieved. High grades in relevant subjects can indicate stronger proficiency and understanding.\n   - **Relevant thesis:** Consider the thesis of the candidate has worked. Advanced projects suggest deeper skills.\n   - **Roles and Responsibilities:** Evaluate the roles and responsibilities held to estimate experience with specific technologies or skills.\n\n\n3. **Experience Estimates:**\n   - **No Zero Experience:** A response of \"0\" is absolutely forbidden. If direct experience cannot be confirmed, provide a minimum of \"2\" years based on inferred or related experience.\n   - **For Low Experience (up to 5 years):** Estimate experience based on inferred bacherol, skills and projects, always providing at least \"2\" years when relevant.\n   - **For High Experience:** For high levels of experience, provide a number based on clear evidence from the resume. Avoid making inferences for high experience levels unless the evidence is strong.\n\n4. **Rules:**\n   - Answer the question directly with a number, avoiding \"0\" entirely.\n\n## Example 1\n```\n## Curriculum\n\nI had a degree in computer science.

For instance, if the candidate has experience with Python and projects involving technologies similar to Java, estimate a reasonable number of years for Java.\n   - **Projects and Studies:** Examine the candidate’s projects and studies to infer skills not explicitly mentioned. Complex and advanced projects often indicate deeper expertise.\n\n2. **Indirect Experience and Academic Background:**\n   - **Type of University and Studies:** Consider the type of university and course followed.\n   - **Exam Grades:** Consider exam grades achieved. High grades in relevant subjects can indicate stronger proficiency and understanding.\n   - **Relevant thesis:** Consider the thesis of the candidate has worked. Advanced projects suggest deeper skills.\n   - **Roles and Responsibilities:** Evaluate the roles and responsibilities held to estimate experience with specific technologies or skills.\n\n\n3. **Experience Estimates:**\n   - **No Zero Experience:** A response of \"0\" is absolutely forbidden. If direct experience cannot be confirmed, provide a minimum of \"2\" years based on inferred or related experience.\n   - **For Low Experience (up to 5 years):** Estimate experience based on inferred bacherol, skills and projects, always providing at least \"2\" years when relevant.\n   - **For High Experience:** For high levels of experience, provide a number based on clear evidence from the resume.

For instance, if the candidate has experience with Python and projects involving technologies similar to Java, estimate a reasonable number of years for Java.\n   - **Projects and Studies:** Examine the candidate’s projects and studies to infer skills not explicitly mentioned. Complex and advanced projects often indicate deeper expertise.\n\n2. **Indirect Experience and Academic Background:**\n   - **Type of University and Studies:** Consider the type of university and course followed.\n   - **Exam Grades:** Consider exam grades achieved. High grades in relevant subjects can indicate stronger proficiency and understanding.\n   - **Relevant thesis:** Consider the thesis of the candidate has worked. Advanced projects suggest deeper skills.\n   - **Roles and Responsibilities:** Evaluate the roles and responsibilities held to estimate experience with specific technologies or skills.\n\n\n3. **Experience Estimates:**\n   - **No Zero Experience:** A response of \"0\" is absolutely forbidden. If direct experience cannot be confirmed, provide a minimum of \"2\" years based on inferred or related experience.\n   - **For Low Experience (up to 5 years):** Estimate experience based on inferred bacherol, skills and projects, always providing at least \"2\" years when relevant.\n   - **For High Experience:** For high levels of experience, provide a number based on clear evidence from the resume. Avoid making inferences for high experience levels unless the evidence is strong.\n\n4. **Rules:**\n   - Answer the question directly with a number, avoiding \"0\" entirely.\n\n## Example 1\n```\n## Curriculum\n\nI had a degree in computer science. I have worked  years with  MQTT protocol.\n\n## Question\n\nHow many years of experience do you have with IoT?\n\n## Answer\n\n4\n```\n## Example 1\n```\n## Curriculum\n\nI had a degree in computer science. \n\n## Question\n\nHow many years of experience do you have with Bash?\n\n## Answer\n\n2\n```\n\n## Example 2\n```\n## Curriculum\n\nI am a software engineer with 5 years of experience in Swift and Python.
